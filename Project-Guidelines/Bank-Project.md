2. Data is stored in a database.
3. Data Access is performed through the use of JDBC in a data layer consisting of Data Access Objects.

Project Evaluation Parameters
1) Your project will be evaluated based on coverage of technology rather than the user stories.
2) How well you present, naming conventions, separation of code into various classes, how well have you applied OOP and design patterns.
3) So you could focus less on user stories and more on coverage of concepts/technologies which you learned during the training.
